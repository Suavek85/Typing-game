# Typing-game
Typing game - JS project

•	my own idea, created from scratch, not based on any online course, still in progress,

•	tried to do something functional and bug free, not necessarily playable, 

•	the three different game levels have been coded in a slightly different way,

•	there's still some room left for improvement especially in terms of structure and DRY-ness, 

•	it's intended for desktop use only
